What is Clustering?
Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised learning to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It involves various methods and algorithms to identify and assign data points to clusters based on their similarities.
Clustering in Unsupervised Learning
Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised learning to group similar objects or data points into clusters. It has various applications, including customer segmentation, document clustering, and image segmentation. Customer segmentation involves grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences to tailor marketing strategies. Document clustering organizes a large collection of documents into thematic clusters for improved information retrieval and topic modeling. Image segmentation partitions an image into segments for object detection and recognition tasks in computer vision.
Internal Evaluation Metrics
Internal metrics evaluate the clustering based on the inherent properties of the data without any external reference. The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Values range from -1 to 1. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters. The Silhouette Score can be calculated using the formula: Silhouette = b - a / max (a, b), where a is the average distance between a sample and all other points in the same cluster, and b is the average distance between a sample and all points in the nearest cluster.
K-Means Clustering: Initialization
K-means clustering is a popular and simple method for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The algorithm begins by randomly selecting K points from the dataset as the initial centroids (cluster centers).

K-Means Clustering Algorithm Overview
The K-means clustering algorithm is an iterative process of moving the centers of clusters or centroids to the mean position of their constituent points, and reassigning instances to their closest clusters iteratively until there is no significant change in the number of cluster centers possible or number of iterations reached. The cost function of K-means is determined by the Euclidean distance (square-norm) between the observations belonging to that cluster with its respective centroid value.

Introduction to K-means++
K-means++ is an enhanced version of the standard K-means clustering algorithm. It addresses a key limitation of K-means: the sensitivity to the initial placement of centroids. Poor initialization can lead to suboptimal clustering and slow convergence, as K-means might get stuck in local minima.

Poor initialization can lead to suboptimal clustering and slow convergence, as K-means might get stuck in local minima. K-means++ improves the initialization step of K-means by ensuring that the initial centroids are spread out across the data space. This increases the likelihood of convergence to a globally optimal solution.
K-Means Clustering Geometric Intuition
K-means clustering is a popular and simple method for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The geometric intuition behind K-means clustering can be understood through the following steps: 1. Initialization - Randomly Select K Centroids:  The algorithm begins by randomly selecting K points from the dataset as the initial centroids (cluster centers). 2. Assignment Step - Assign Points to Nearest Centroid:  Each data point in the dataset is assigned to the nearest centroid. This forms K clusters based on the current positions of the centroids.  Geometric Intuition:  Imagine each centroid having a region of influence. Each data point belongs to the centroid whose region it lies in. This is akin to partitioning the space into Voronoi cells around each centroid.

What is Hierarchical Clustering?
Hierarchical clustering is a method of grouping data into a hierarchy or “tree” of clusters. It separates data into groups based on some measure of similarity and forms a tree-like structure called a Dendrogram. It is useful for data summarization and visualization.
Agglomerative Clustering Steps
1. Calculate dissimilarity between objects. 2. Cluster objects together if they minimize a given agglomeration criterion. 3. Calculate dissimilarity between the class and the remaining objects using the agglomeration criterion. 4. Cluster the two objects or classes of objects together if they minimize the agglomeration criterion. 5. Repeat steps 2-4 until only one cluster remains.
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
Starts with each object forming its own cluster, then iteratively merges clusters into larger ones until all objects are in a single cluster. The merging step involves finding the two closest clusters and combining them into one.

It forms a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which is useful for data summarization and visualization. It works by grouping data objects into a hierarchy or tree of clusters, allowing for the organization of data into groups at different levels.
Introduction to Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical methods create a hierarchical decomposition of the given set of data objects. They can be classified as agglomerative or divisive, based on how the hierarchical decomposition is formed. Agglomerative approach starts with each object forming a separate group and successively merges the objects or groups close to one another. Divisive approach starts with all the objects in the same cluster and splits into smaller clusters until each object is in one cluster.

Hierarchical clustering is separating data into groups based on some measure of similarity, finding a way to measure how they’re alike and different, and further narrowing down the data.

Space and Time Complexity of Hierarchical Clustering Technique
The space complexity of Hierarchical Clustering Technique is O(n²) where n is the number of data points. This is because the similarity matrix needs to be stored in the RAM. The time complexity is O(n³) where n is the number of data points. This is because n iterations are performed and in each iteration, the similarity matrix needs to be updated and restored.
